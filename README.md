# pal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pal)

The PAL is a Platform Abstraction Layer that is used in a variety of
projects. The PAL allows for easy compatibility between many different
flavors of UNIX/Linux, including AIX 6.1 and later, HP/UX 11.31 and
later, Solaris 5.10 and later, MACos, and most versions of Linux as
far back as RedHat 5.0, SuSE 10.1, and Debian 5.0.

The PAL has two primary components:

- [SCXCoreLib](#scxcorelib)
- [SCXSystemLib](#scxsystemlib)

### SCXCoreLib

SCXCoreLib provides portable services for:

- atomic handling
- UNIX conditions
- directory lookup
- file handling (reading/writing/modifying)
- ref-counted handle mechanism to release on last use
- common logging framework
- marshalling/unmarshalling
- DNS name resolution
- pocess launching/controlling
- regular expressions
- singletons
- thrading
- time handling
- other various functions

The above list is not intended to be all-inclusive. Features are added
to the PAL as necessary.

### SCXSystemLib

SCXSystemLib primarily returns statistical information for products
like [SCXcore][] and [SCXcm][], and other [omi][] providers. This
subsystem primarily follows the CIM module (enumerate a set of
instances, get detailed information on a specific instance).

[SCXcore]: https://github.com/Microsoft/SCXcore
[SCXcm]: https://github.com/Microsoft/SCXcm
[omi]: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi

Primary enumeration information is supported for:

- bios
- computer system
- cpu statistics
- cpu property information
- disk information
- file system information
- installed software
- memory information
- network configuration
- network routing information
- operating system information
- process information
- processor information

This component tends to be highly system specific, and may run on
fewer systems than [SCXCoreLib](#scxcorelib), above.
